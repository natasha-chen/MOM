# MOM
NewHacks 2025 Project!!

We built MOM around one simple idea: what if taking care of yourself felt like having your mom around?

Between school, work, burnout, and the constant pressure to “stay productive,” it’s easy to forget the basics: stretch your neck, drink water, take a breath, and maybe even rest your brain for five minutes. So, we wanted to create something that doesn’t just track your wellbeing, but cares for it. We started with the three pillars of wellbeing:

Physical — Stretching, neck & back pain

Mental — Stress, burnout, and that feeling of being overwhelmed by school, jobs, and, life.

Productivity — The never-ending battle with time management and procrastination.

What MOM Does:
Reminds you to take care of your body with gentle stretch or movement prompts 
Checks in on your mental health with small reflections and mood boosts
Helps organize your tasks and keep you accountable — without judgment
Encourages you when you fall behind
Reminds remind you to be kind to yourself.

We don’t want wellness to feel like another task.
We want it to feel like being cared for.
